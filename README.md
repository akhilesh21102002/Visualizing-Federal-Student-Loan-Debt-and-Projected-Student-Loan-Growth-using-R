# U.S. Federal Student Debt Analysis (2007â€“2021)

This project analyzes total U.S. federal student loan debt from 2007 to 2021, including Direct Loans, Perkins Loans, and FFEL, using data from [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/).

The analysis visualizes the rising debt trend over time and applies an ARIMA model to forecast debt levels for the next decade. The project is implemented in R using RStudio, and highlights the potential impact of policy and economic changes on federal student loan balances.
